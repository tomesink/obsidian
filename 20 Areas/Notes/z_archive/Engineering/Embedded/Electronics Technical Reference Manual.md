A TRM goes more in-depth than a datasheet.  While a datasheet offers a high-level view of a device's features and specifications, a TRM provides a comprehensive technical detail about the device. It describes its functions, internal architecture, process of operations, and contains information for designers about how to programmatically control or interface with the device.
