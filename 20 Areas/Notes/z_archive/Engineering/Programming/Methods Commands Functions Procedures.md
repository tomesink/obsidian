In programming nowadays the differentiation is lost.

Basics of *Programming* is description of *objects* (not necessarily in 
OOP sense) and *actions*.

**Procedure**

Sequence of commands/step. A list of steps. Algorithm.
Different from function.
Procedure does not have to return a value.
Lots of side effects.

Example: List all the files in the directory.

**Function**

It is NOT Procedure, Operation(Interface) nor Method.
It ALWAYS **returns** a value.
It is named and can accept arguments (but does not have to have any 
input. But it should have an input).

Ideally a black box (pure function). Input in and return out.

A function is self-contained and can be **tested**.

Example: get object. sum x and y.
