Use racial tech to stall and take action cards from others 

Standard race, not situational. Play standard opening.

Very universal race. Focus on early expansion 

Focus rather on cruisers (because yellow path)

You can decide to go blue if this is useful 

Trade action cards with Hacan 

Don't give your racial promissory 

Don't take lead. Score behind ( prepare for scoring 4 points in late game).

Don't be aggressive. Be a friend

You don't have to invade people but use devastating action card instead.

Look for action cards synergies 

Strategy: depends on the board. Warfare, Politics, Trade, Diplomacy, Tech 

Secondaries: Tech 

Tech: green path (hypermetabolism) or blue. Let the action cards leads you
