# Hacan

## General

trade in agenda phase

Only Hacan can trade action cards 

Place dock ASAP 

Get as much money as possible and bank them

Get paid for replenishing

Racial tech only for late game 
Quantum Data hub, only for late game

Buy 2 Dreadnoughts instead of flagship

You are very close to Dreadnought II  

Prefer yellow skips for racial 3 yellow tech. But don't prefer yellow skips instead of good pie slice.  Green AND Yellow skip is very good combo 

You need a good economy 

It makes sense to exchange racial promisories with Mentac. Don't give it to Jolnar 

Get 12 trade goods in first round for trade. Build fleets with Dreadnoughts 

Bank your VPS for late game to score tier II VPs

Place another space docks 

Build fleet slowly every round 

Play normal game and Use trade goods as a backup. Wait for VP II 

Don't give Jolnar anything 

## Podcasts (space cats): 

Strategy :
Trade ( play it as first actions). Politics 
Never take Warfare in first round 

Secondaries : Tech, Warfare 

Tech path : Neural motivator , Gravity. Than stop and look around. From there go for any useful tech which helps to get VPs.

Don't go deep blue

Red tech is not advisable

## Technology

*Foundation Tech Cluster (Neural Motivator > Plasma Scoring > PDS > Unit Upgrades)*

*
*Carrier/Fighter Cluster (Neural Motivator > Gravity Drive > Antimass > Dreadnought II*

 - for building strong fleet*

*## Strategy cards*
*
*
*0. Trade, whenever you can in early game. Especially in 1st round. Statrt*
*
*
*1. Leadership (assuming trade is taken)*

Leadership is in my opinion the most all round and advantageous first round pick for almost any race. No one will likely use the secondary so you will get ahead on CC economy, you can counter someone stalling with warfare and you can execute more secondaries than anyone else.

Dream Expansion Round

T1 Expand to a 2 planet system
Trade secondary for 6 TG and Tech for Gravity Drive
T2 Expand to a 2 planet system
Diplomacy Secondary for 5 resources
T3 Leadership,exhaust Hercant 1/1 and Kamdorn 0,1 and use a TG for 1 CC
Secondary of Warfare build 2 Dreadnaughts and 2I (You have exactly 8 resources left after tech and leadership)
Secondary of politics/construction/imperial if you like, all of them if you really want
T4 Expand to 1 planet with a Dreadnaught
T5 Expand to 1 planet with a Dreadnaught
Pass

You end up with two dreadnaughts, 4 systems controlled with 6 new planets total and gravity drive tech all in round 1. Not to mention potentially 2 space docks, 2 action cards and an extra secret objective. This would probably raise the eyebrows and ire of everyone on the board though haha. Severely hindering your trade relations, but it would be an awesome play!

*2. Diplomacy (assuming trade is taken)*

A few more resources or influence from refreshing is nice but it depends on what systems you can refresh turn 1. This strategy card does make it risky to be warfare stalled. Overall an ok card but not great.

*3. Politics (assuming trade is taken)*

Politics is an amazing card for the Hacan round 1, you can leverage the speaker token for trade goods and you can start building your action card hand early to make critical trades later. This strategy plus grabbing neural motivator first round will set you up with 4 cards round 2! Perfect for your general strategy. Dream Politics round:

T1 Expand to a 2 planet system
Trade secondary for ~6 TG and Tech for Neural Motivator
T2 Politics, sell speaker token to highest bidder
Secondary Leadership,exhaust Hercant 1/1 and Kamdorn 0,1 and use a TG for 1 CC
Secondary of Warfare build 1 Carrier and 2I and whatever else you like
T3 Expand to a 2 planet system
T4 Expand with last Carrier
Pass
