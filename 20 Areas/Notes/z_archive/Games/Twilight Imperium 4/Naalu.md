Naalu

Early game race. Maybe mid game (time to shine in midgame)
Dont annoy players in midgame

Don't invest on big ships except mothership. Build only fighters II 
and Second carrier 

NO NEED to build Destroyers, Cruisers or Dreadnoughts

Use Fighters as ground combat but have at least 1 ground force because fighters come back to mothership after the combat

Rush for fighters and RUSH for gloves as fast as possible. Skip daxive get hypermetabolism on the way to neuralgives

If possible start close to GREEN or BLUE, and/or 2 planet system

In high value system build a second dock and produce high value of fighters

You need lots of tokens - take leadership and have high influence value planets

If retreat, you can not retreat to a system with some other’s SHIPS -> You can retreat to somebody’s system with unprotected planets

Be annoying. Try to get trade goods for getting out of other player’s way (but go to some other player way).

Better not to attack others, instead, let them to come.

STRATEGY CARDS - you need teching at the beginning

Tech, Diplomacy, Leadership, Construction
 
Secondary : warfare, tech

TECH: Blue (antimass)/Green (skip if possible and RUSH for neural glave)

MID GAME: Tech - fleet logistics (2 actions before anyone can play in a turn)

Counter against: Arborec, Sol with the flagship, Saar (probably cant pass through in a mid game)

Counter us: (could be Yin), Xccha (can destroy carrier ships), L1Z1 (same as Xccha), Necro with flagship
