when your sats are heavy to the inbound side (green, right side), you should bump your fees UP and vice versa.

base fee vs fee rate: [Channel Fees | Builder's Guide](https://docs.lightning.engineering/lightning-network-tools/lnd/channel-fees)

### Channels

Local (blue in Thunderhub) liquidity is the OUTBOUND liquidity (how many local sats we can send out from us).

Remote (the green in Thunderhub) liquidity is the INBOUND liquidity (how many sats we can receive in).
