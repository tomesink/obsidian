Individual mortgages were aggregated into one unit. This unit than was used to issue securities. Home buyers than sends money to owners of the security not the lenders of the original loan. 

Before this system, home buyers paid their monthly payments to their local lenders (eg. local banks). And the lender expected the payments and he wanted them back. Lenders were very careful about who they are borrow.

`HOME BUYER ---> LENDER`

But with the new system, the lender borrows money to the home buyer but sell this debt to an investment bank. The investment bank combines this mortgage with thousands of other mortgages and other loans and creates a securities called [[Collaterilazed Debt Obligation (CDO)]]. Than the investment bank re-sell these securities to individual investors. Lenders now do not have to worry about getting their money back, they already got paid by investment bank. 

The monthly payments go now to the investors (owners of these securities).

Such aggregation made from originally illiquid asset (mortgage) standardised security traded on capital markets.

Securitization of mortgages started already in 1970s and 1980s.
The boom started after 2000 with new money printed by central banks.

The existence of investors eager for any yield regardless of risk is a blessings for banks.

There were also other types of securitizations for other types of credits (uver) or for income expected in the future eg. flight destinations of airline companies.
