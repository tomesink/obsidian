Permanent note is a SINGLE IDEA. Small as possible or one topic only. It must be easy to understand after reading. Permanent note should focus on one thing, on one concept.

Source for Permanent note is a [[Literature note]] or more of them.
After reading I must comprehend what it means.

[[Mischa van der Burg]] [suggests](https://university.webflow.com/courses/css-layout-and-positioning) that a permanent/atomic note is a self contained unit of knowledge, written in our words and this unit should be prepared to be published (it can function independently) - not necessarily as a single article but rather single paragraph on a specific topic. So the permament note does not have to be ridicuously small.

There is an interesting parallel to [[Unix Philosophy]], meaning the Permanent note should do one thing, do it only and do it well.
