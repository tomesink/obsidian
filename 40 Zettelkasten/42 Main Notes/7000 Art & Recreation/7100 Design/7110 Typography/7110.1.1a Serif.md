# 700.1.1a Serif

Serifs are fonts with little decorations.

It is a leftover from times where the letters were manually chopped into a stone and left this tiny mark (like cuneiform - "kl√≠nopis").

Serifs are used used for print (typically newspapers, books).

Serifs are old school looking (used typically by banks, banks communicate something old).

Associated with something more premium, serious, important, established, conservative(?) or artistic feeling.
