Prefer influence over resources and build cheap units - infantry, fighters, carriers 

Establish second dock base. Perhaps near Mecatol.

Perhaps no need to build units in round 1

No need to build big ships. Upgraded carriers and fighters are enough 

Focus on CCD. Take leadership often 

Consistently place grand forces on planets. Same as for Arborec 

Strategy - Tech, Politics to pick Tech, Leadership, Warfare 

Secondaries - Tech 

Tech - gravity, carrier II, fighters II, daxive ,infantry II. Always research these. Order depends on situation. Maybe sarveen

Donâ€™t skip blue. We want all blue tech. 
We want green skip for hyper or yellow for transit diods
