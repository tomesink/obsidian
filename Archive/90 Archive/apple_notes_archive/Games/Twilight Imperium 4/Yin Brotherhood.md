# Yin Brotherhood 

Better at being attacked than attacking.

Try to get lots of systems as fast as possible.

You are the Mecatol and early game race. Try to go to the Mecatol as fast as possible. You are good at holding it.

Focus on early objectives and hold them. Collect VPs early, get lead and expect to defend yourself in a late game.

Don't use Devotion / sacrifice with destroyers  offensively. Same with flagship.

You need more influence planets than resources 

Don't waste command tokens

Place destroyes everywhere. Use Devotion with them when being attacked 

Collect planets with more influence. Ideally 0/2. Planets with yellow and green (better yellow than green)

Don't spend 0/2 influence planets on getting command tokens from round 4

Strategy : it does not matter. Warfare would be useful for expansion. 
Leadership ( take it whenever you can later)
Tech 

Secondary - 1. Tech, and that's it. Don't spend CC

Techs : 

don't get impulse core, get transite  diodes instead. They are better.
Focus on green and yellow skip.

Rush for daxive motivator and infantry II as fast as possible. Skip Neural motivator if possible. Thank Dock II (if on Mecatol) Than daxive and hypermetabolism. Cruiser II 

SECON ROUND- build 2 infantry, 1 carrier and 1 Destroyer. 

Get Warfare, Leadership or Tech

Go for Mecatol and try to use non home planets . Or Take it from someone. Mecatol is a key for win ( together with good objectives)

This is critical round - you are vulnerable.

From ROUND THREE if on Mecatol, having Space dock II, build ground forces and fleets and you can go everywhere 

We counter : Saar/ poorly defended planets, early Sol

Counters us: Late game Sol, Arborec, Xxcha, L1Z1, Letnev
