## General

Turtle, dont be aggressive at the beginning. Be everybody’s buddy

Get flagship (protected with Fighter screen) early and setup PDS grid. It's enough to have one PDS on planet (except for home system and Mecatol)

With Diplomacy and Construction establish PDS and Space dock at the edge of your pie slice 

Do standard activations no crazy moves 

If run for Mecatol place upgraded PDSs on Mecatol but you have to have well defended home system (4 PDSs)

You want pie slice with planets not with empty space. You actually want someone to attack you

Tech - Plasma scoring -> PDS II, Sarveen, Nullification Field, … neural motivators / advanced ground forces or maybe upgrade space dock if you have it at the edge of pie slice 

dont go deeper in red

Maybe no need to buy any blue tech 

## Strategy Card

Pick anything which leads to VP, otherwise Diplomacy in first turn or COnstruction, build PDS gird, 

Counters : moving races, Ghosts, L1Z1, Barony.
