# Jesus Dont Resist

In Matthew 5:38-4 Jesus said: "“You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye 
for eye, and tooth for tooth.’ But I tell you, do not resist an evil 
person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other 
cheek also."

Does that mean we should be cowards? No. He meant: Do not answer evil
with evil. We should not revenge. This is based on an old Jewis (old
testament) principle of facing to injustice with dignity. We should not
be angry. We just must be dignified.

He does not forbid fighting against Evil in the world at all! On the
contrary.
