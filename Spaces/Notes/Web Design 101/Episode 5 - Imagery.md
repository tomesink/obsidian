How to pick up an image:

1. Choose the right style/genre (photography or illustrationâ€¦)
2. Pick the right image inside the style
3. Use it correctly (in layout composition)

ad 1) Genres (or web design styles ): artistic, (normal) photography, illustration vector, minimal (text and colors only), illustration hand made, graphic, 3d,

Photography genre - very realistic, show real product, real person, real story

Illustration - telling more complex stories via one image, if you want to use metaphor

3d - combination of real life with abstraction (3d models looking like real, eg. phone)

ad 2) Either take/create photos/illustrations/3Ds by yourself (or hire someone to create it) or buy it from stock. depends on budget.

pexels.com is free resource

ad 3) Make sure: you have high quality image, there is some kind of layout in the image, there is a space where we might position a text, there is a contrast with the background (there are not so many details in foreground).
