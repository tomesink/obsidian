Words are powerful that's why text is important.

Type of font can create a feel about what we want to communicate through our design.

Typeface = font.

Typography is a crafty skill. I need to practice a lot with manipulating fonts. It takes time to learn to see what is good and what is not.

People do not want to read long lines. Make sure your lines or paragraphs are not too long.

Ran Seagall recommends to have lines/paragraphs about 10 words (roughly).

He also recommends these 2 excercises:

1. Pick up a word from dictionary and its description and try to create a kinda of a "poster" out of it from title and paragraph. Try different fonts, sizes, layout, colors maybe? Everyday challenge on social networks?
2. Create composition of typographic from my favourite people (authors, musiciansâ€¦) and design a daily quote.

### The purpose of the font:

1. Deliver information (legibility). It needs to be easy to read (bad font, too small/big, not readable color).
2. Communicate values (aesthetics). Is this a friendly brand? Serious brand?

Main types of fonts are Serif and Sans-Serif. There can be also "script" fonts which resembles handwriting.

### Width of the font

From Light to bold. The more bold the more black the character are.

Important for hierarchy.

### Tracking

How much space we have between ALL the letters of given typeface.

Default is usually ok.

### Kerning

How much space we have between TWO selected letters.

With big size, sometimes happens that some letters have more space than others.

Usually we do not do kerning unless we work on logos or big titles.

### Line height

Usually relates to a paragraphs (type of area where lines are broken automatically.

But also if a title or line text area (not a paragraph) is manually break down onto new line. MY TITLE

vs.

MY

TITLE

How much space we have between lines.

Usually default is good. But if you adjust word length in a paragraph (shortening) there might be too big white space between lines.

Lines must not be too tight not too spread.

### What kind of font to choose?

as a beginner, do not reinvent wheel. [Massimo Vignelli](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimo_Vignelli) an italian famous designer used only 6 types of fonts (both serif and sans serif).

- Garamond, 1532
- Bodoni, 1788
- Century Expanded, 1900
- Futura, 1930 (sans-serif)
- Times Roman, 1931
- Helvetica, 1957 (sans-serif)

Unfortunately, some of these are premium fonts (available with Adobe subscription)

As a beginner, I can also choose 6-10 fonts and use these. I can google for Vignelli fonts alternatives.

### What size to choose?

Go to [https://typescale.com/](https://typescale.com/) to see hierarchy of fonts, how they would look on your website.

Usually no need to have more than 3-4 headings.
