Kubernetes was originally developed by Google, drawing from their experience in running containerized workloads at scale with the internal platform called Borg. Kubernetes was later donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in 2015.

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source container orchestration
platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of
containerized applications.
