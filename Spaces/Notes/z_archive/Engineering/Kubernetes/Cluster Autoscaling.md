Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaling automatically adjusts the size of a cluster by adding or removing worker nodes based on the overall resource requirements of the cluster. 

This enables efficient resource utilization and ensures that the cluster has enough capacity to run workloads without over-provisioning resources.
