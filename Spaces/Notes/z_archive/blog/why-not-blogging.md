Because why not? :) ... Ok, ok, this deserves better explanation since
this is my first blog post.

I've recently left all social networks to protect my own sanity and privacy.
The only socials media I'm currently using is
[Nostr](https://bit.ly/3T2tY7b) which is more community than a social
network (at least for now). Nostr serves very well my occasional short
"twetts" but sometimes I feel an urge to share something longer to read.

You know, as many other IT engineers I have been building my own
personal wiki (also called second brain, personal knowledge management,
zettelkasten... whatewer it is called) and sometimes I feel I could show
some of them to the world. Or write about my IT side projects I am
working on, etc.

This might be beneficial for someone. You never know who will stumble
upon my web in the future. And it will be also beneficial for me as this
blog could serve me as a kind of "business card" and I hope it will also
help me to improve my English.
