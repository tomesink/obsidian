VERSION 2:**PostApo Talk Episode 0: Introduction**

**Intro**

* **Video**: A montage of post-apocalyptic footage and images, such as ruined cities, abandoned vehicles, and people struggling to survive.

* **SCRIPT**: 

1. What would you do if the world ended tomorrow? How would you survive? What would you fight for? Have you ever wondered what life would be like after the apocalypse? If you have, then you’re on the right place. 
2. Hi wastelanders, and welcome to the first episode of PostApo Talk! My name is [your name], and I’m the creator of the Kids of Pripyat channel. This is a new format on my channel, where I’ll be talking about post-apocalyptic culture, movies, games, books, and futuristic themes.

I’ve always been fascinated by post-apocalyptic stories ever since I was a kid. I grew up watching movies like The Terminator, The Matrix, and 28 Days Later. I also played games like Half-Life, Metro, and Bioshock. And I read books like The Stand, The Road, and The Hunger Games. These stories opened my eyes to a whole new world of possibilities and challenges. They also made me think about the real world and the problems we face as a society.

That’s why I started the Kids of Pripyat channel. I wanted to share my passion for post-apocalyptic culture with other people who share the same interest. I also wanted to create content that is entertaining, educational, and inspiring. On my channel, you can find videos where I explore abandoned places, test survival gear, and interview survivors of real-life disasters.

**Why I love post-apocalyptic culture**

* **Video**: A close-up of a post-apocalyptic survivor, looking determined and hopeful.

*  But why do I love post-apocalyptic culture so much? Well, there are many reasons. First of all, I love post-apocalyptic culture because it forces us to confront our own mortality and think about what’s truly important in life. When everything we know and love is gone, what do we have left? What do we value? What do we need? What do we want? Post-apocalyptic stories make us reflect on these questions and help us appreciate what we have.

Secondly, I love post-apocalyptic culture because it makes us think about the fragility of our world and the importance of protecting it. We live in a time where our planet is facing multiple threats, such as climate change, nuclear war, pandemics, or social collapse. Post-apocalyptic stories show us the consequences of these threats and warn us about the dangers of ignoring them. They also show us the potential solutions and alternatives that we can pursue to prevent or mitigate these threats.
But more than that, I love post-apocalyptic culture because it’s full of hope. Even in the darkest of times, there’s always the possibility of a new beginning. Post-apocalyptic stories often show us how people can overcome adversity and build a better future for themselves. They show us how people can find meaning and purpose in a chaotic world. They show us how people can form bonds and communities in a hostile environment. They show us how people can adapt and evolve in a changing world.
Some examples of post-apocalyptic stories that influenced me or resonated with me are:
* The Walking Dead: This is a comic book series and a TV show that follows a group of survivors in a zombie apocalypse. It shows how they struggle to survive, cope with loss, and deal with other groups of survivors who may be allies or enemies.
* Horizon Zero Dawn: This is a video game that takes place in a far future where machines have taken over the world and humans live in primitive tribes. It follows the story of Aloy, a young woman who sets out to discover her origins and the secrets of the past.
* Station Eleven: This is a novel that tells the story of a traveling theater troupe in a post-pandemic world where civilization has collapsed. It explores the themes of art, culture, memory, and connection in a post-apocalyptic setting.

What to expect from PostApo Talk
* Video: A montage of post-apocalyptic books, movies, and games.
* Voiceover: On PostApo Talk, I’ll be talking about a wide range of post-apocalyptic topics. I’ll be reviewing movies, games, and books that feature post-apocalyptic scenarios or themes. I’ll also be discussing broader themes like survival skills, environmental issues, social dynamics, and ethical dilemmas that arise in post-apocalyptic scenarios.

I want PostApo Talk to be a place where people can come to learn about post-apocalyptic culture and share their own thoughts and ideas. So please feel free to leave comments and suggestions on what you want me to talk about or review on the show. And I’ll do my best to respond.

I also have some exciting plans for upcoming episodes or guests that I want to share with you. For example:
* In one episode, I’ll be talking to [name], an expert on nuclear energy and radiation who will explain the science behind nuclear disasters like Chernobyl or Fukushima.
* In another episode, I’ll be talking to [name], an author of a popular post-apocalyptic novel who will share their inspiration and writing process for creating their story.
* In another episode, I’ll be talking to [name], a creator of a post-apocalyptic game who will show me some behind-the-scenes footage and gameplay features of their game.

Next episode: Stalker
* Video: A clip from the movie Stalker, showing the Stalker leading the Writer and the Professor through the Zone.
* Voiceover: In my next episode, I’ll be talking about one of my favorite post-apocalyptic films of all time: Stalker. Stalker is a 1979 film directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, based on the novel Roadside Picnic by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. 

* ~~It follows~~

~~the journey of three men: the Stalker, who guides them; the Writer, who seeks inspiration; and the Professor, who seeks knowledge; as they enter the Zone, a mysterious area where the laws of physics are altered and where one’s deepest wishes can be fulfilled. Stalker is a film that challenges us to question our beliefs, our desires, and our purpose in life. It also shows us the beauty and the danger of the unknown and the power of faith and hope in a bleak world.~~
~~Stalker is widely regarded as a masterpiece of post-apocalyptic cinema and one of Tarkovsky’s best works. It has influenced many other filmmakers and artists, such as Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan, and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game series. It has also been praised for its philosophical depth, artistic vision, and atmospheric sound design.~~

If you haven’t seen Stalker yet, I highly recommend you to watch it. It’s a film that will stay with you for a long time and make you think about your own life and choices. And if you have seen it before, I invite you to rewatch it with me and share your thoughts and opinions on it.
