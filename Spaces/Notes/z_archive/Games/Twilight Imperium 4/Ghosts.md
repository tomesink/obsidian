# Ghosts 

Very situational race 

Good in taking planets. Scoring secrets 

Take best planet in your home slice 

Always Collect influence to capitalize on undefended planets in mid and later game

Try to trade a lot. Sell promissory note

Put your warm holes in your pie slice. At least one. Ideally in all slices 

Place a space dock to a good planet in your pie slice. With this you don't need to build flagship. Build fighters and infantry 

Don't take early lead. Score from behind in late game.

Strategies : Trade (to play both warfare and tech), Politics (than take politic leadership in round two).Leadership, Warfare.

In later game tak leadership as much as possible. 

Secondaries : Warfare, Tech

Tech : neuromotivator  is a must. Daxive, Infantry II, fighter II, carrier II (better take this than Dreadnought II) Dimentional splicer. Eventually PDS II.
