Trade in agenda phase

Firstly build carrier and 2 infantry 

Flagship is crucial defence unit. Put it to home system in mid game with ground forces 

Have twice units than opponent when attacking. He will take twice more damage

Go for Mecatol if tech objectives in game 

Try to be a neighborhood of tech races

## Tech 
There is no tech path. Get good techs. 

### Version 1
Get Gravity drive first. Focus on it. 
Destroyer II
Infantry II
Fleet logistics

### Version 2
Tech - Sarveen, Gravity drive, Transide diods - very powerful with flagship. Letani II, both Sol racial. Hegemony from Winnu. Conduit cylinder from Jol nar, Non Euclidean shielding from Barony, Sardak Dreadnought II, war suns, advanced docks, Impulse core from Yin.. All it depends  if on Mecatol go for defensive techs

## Strategy Cards:

Overall: trade and leadership

### Round 1
Stall for Warfare. Be plastic focused

Dont split dreadnought and carrier if possible. 

**Picks**:

1. Trade - negotiate with warfare player
2. Leadership - stall
3. Technology - stall
4. Politics - stall with agent
5. Warfare 
6. Construction - if a good planet for second dock. **RISK - no stall** 

Later pick Politics couple of times

**Build**: If trade goods gained, 1 dread 1 cruiser 4 infantry. If not, 1 carrier 2 infantry

### Round 2

Score a point.
Get plastic on the table.

Politics, Trade, Warfare, Tech (if not in first round)

Secondaries : Warfare, tech/ Diplomacy 

Build dereadnoughts for bombardments

**Round 3+**
