Dont be warmonger, but rather advantageous with cheap units. strike systems where people make mistakes.

Late game killers

Dont loose fights. Mobility is your friend.

+ 1 to units - its better having 8 fighters than 1 dreadnought (statistically)

GENERAL TECH RULES: better upgrade (cheap) units than collecting techs
If I have 2 blue and 2 green -> 3 units upgrade, with sarween 4 unit upgrades

Any tech is good, preferably dont skip any green (maybe skip neural but its situational)

Blue is also good

Try to get big pieslice  with lots of RESOURCES and TECH specialities 

Have one friendly neighbour. Hold on this alliance. Try to exploit the other neighbour

Focus on cheap units and big fleets. I need more units in early game than the others. The cheaper the unit the better (even ground forces, they are equal to Sols basic infantry)

Have 2 docks in home system OrlicÃ­ adjacent 

Try to fulfill on all Tier 1 VPs.  Be diplomatic

Sell your promisory note as much as possible (to Jol-Nar, Barony, Xxcha, L1Z1, to people who are targetting Sol or Arborec) for 2-3 trade goods or promisory notes (mainly Jol-nar)

If having Jol-nar PN, dont wait too long to spend it. You need to fill up the tech gap ASAP (there are lots of tech VPs)

Racial techs - based on objectives. If secret objective - you need to research them.

			Dreadnought II - you choose which units to destroy!!!! (you may destory 2 war suns by 1 Dreadnought). BUT its non essential tech. hard to research it. moreover you have +1. still cheap units are better. might be good against Muaat, Letnev

			Valkyre - also not essential. maybe against sol and arborec if you are sandwitched between those two

Let VPs guide you. Lots of useful and pointless techs but it depends on game.

Big fleet pool -> 2 fleets and combine them at one point unexpectly

Strategies: 1. Trade - get trade partner, 6 trade goods, build as many units as possible (cheap, not dreadnought in 1st round) 	

		   2. Tech (is diplomacy in game?, do I have trade partner?)) At least one in game you need to take Tech as primary

		   3. Diplomacy - for extra cash

		   4. Leadership - to increase fleet pool. try grab at some point in the game. I need bigger fleets

OR
Tech, Politics, leadership 

Ideally: 1st turn politics , 2st Tech, 3rd Trade 

Secondaries:   1. Tech
			2. Warfare - build units that can move 1st round (destoryers, cruisers)
			
			

Tech: Sarveen, Gravity drive (with blue tech speciality and diplomacy primary/secondary). 2 blue, 2 green + Sarveen -> 4 unit upgrades (Cruiser)
	You will not go deep int otech trees.

OR: neural, anti mass , fighter II, gravity
2 blue, 2 green
If no tech skip, carrier 2, sarveen, dreadnought 2
