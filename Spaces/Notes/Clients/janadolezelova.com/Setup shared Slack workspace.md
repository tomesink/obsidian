## Subtasks

- [ ] Invite team to Slack connect
- [ ] Intro using templated message

Hey everyone, just setting up this @channel to run all communication on the website through. This way information is never siloed in 1-1 messages or email threads. This channel + Notion will be where everything [input website name] lives.

If you ever have any questions just holler ⚡️

Please add anyone I’ve missed to this slack connect channel!
