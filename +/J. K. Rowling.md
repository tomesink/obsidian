Tweet from 2019. She explicitly stated that it does not matter who is who, how they dress or who they sleep with.

She defended women saying that males and females are different and she is attacked for it as transphobic.

If a woman says that males and females are not the same, that there are differences, and that the woman is being attacked as transphobic. And J.K.R. attacks those people who say these women are transphobic.

Ji se vlastne nelibil utok jako takovy, na tu zenu a jen se ji zastala, aniz by ji vlastne obhajovala. Ona ani neobhajovala to, co ta zena rika.

Ta zena jen rikala, ze "sex is real" coz neni zadna transfobie.

Jestli je tohle transfobni, tak asi ziju v jine dimenzi.

Pak uz se vsude jelo, ze je transfob, byla onalepkovana.

She even posted an "apologise" tweet "I respect any trans person… I would march with you if you were discriminated… but at the same time my life has been shaped by being female"

Co je na tom transfobniho?

She is basically saying: you can live hocalcw you want and I want to live how I want.

Only because people say she is transphobic it does not mean she really is.

Ale samozrejme nevim kam se posunula ted.
