It is very important [[Become intentional about content consumption]]. 


Better than "smart" apps. [The smarter new apps are, the dumber they
get](https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/6/5475778/the-smarter-news-apps-are-the-dumber-they-get)

Why? Because I can see everything from the feeds and read only what I
want to read.

Years ago the Internet was full of optimism that in the future there
will be intelligent agents capable of searching suitable informations for
us. They would know exactly what we want, why we want and when we want
it.

This future is now and this is not happening. Such perfect algorithms
still do not exists. Although social media are trying. Yes, these social
media who require to know everything about us to feed these faulty,
usually annoying algorithms. If Twitter is trying to
recommend me a content it usually fails.

So no, thanks.
