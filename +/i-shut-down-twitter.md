I've shut down Twitter for good. And rediscovered or rather finally
appreciated RSS. It's AWESOME. 

You decide what you want to subscribe to, you make your own feed, you
decide what you want to see. And no ads, free, no one collects my data.

I can't believe I used to have Twitter for this. And the best thing is
that if I want to, I can also follow twitter(reddit, youtube...)
accounts via rss.
