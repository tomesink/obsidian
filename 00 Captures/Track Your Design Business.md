How many new leads did you get last month? üò¨‚Å†  
How about your % of closing leads over the last year? ‚Å†  
When my business coach first asked me these questions, I was had no answers.‚Å†  
"How are we going to fix your business if you don't even know where you stand today?" he asked me. ‚Å†  
-‚Å†  
Needless to say, I was too busy "being creative!!"‚Å†  
Silly me. ‚Å†  
-‚Å†  
I know I‚Äôm not alone. ‚Å†  
In fact, I think 95% of designers don‚Äôt keep track of their numbers. I think they don‚Äôt even know what CRM means and they have no idea what their proposal conversion rate is. It‚Äôs a very simple task but why don‚Äôt we do it? Because it‚Äôs BORING.‚Å†  
-‚Å†  
But you know what is not boring? Making good money from the work you do! being able to support your lifestyle and family doing design work.‚Å†  
-‚Å†  
Tracking numbers help us become mindful, make better decisions, and lead our next actions.‚Å†  
Did you not get leads today? What can you do to attract more clients? ‚Å†  
Is your conversion rate low? How can you improve your negotiation skills? ‚Å†  
-‚Å†  
Just in case you want to start tracking your numbers, answer these questions for starters::‚Å†  
How many people have you talked to?‚Å†  
How many leads have you generated?‚Å†  
How many proposals have you sent?‚Å†  
How many did you close?‚Å†  
-‚Å†  
Will you start today?‚Å†
