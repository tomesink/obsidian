* **		EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)**:
	* This is a measure of a company's operational profitability. It tells you how much money the company made from its core business operations, without considering interest, taxes, and non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization.
	* Think of it as a way to look at a company's raw operational performance without the noise of other financial factors.
	* 

	* **EBITDA**: There isn't a "recommended" EBITDA value per se. Instead, investors often compare EBITDA across companies in the same industry to determine which ones are more operationally efficient.

* **		P/E (Price-to-Earnings Ratio)**:
	* This ratio tells you how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. A high P/E might suggest that the market expects high growth from the company in the future.
	* It's like evaluating how much you'd pay for a slice of cake based on how tasty you think it is.
	* A lower P/E ratio could indicate that a stock is undervalued, while a higher P/E might suggest overvaluation. However, this varies by industry.
	* Historically, the average P/E for the broader market has been around 15-20, but this can fluctuate based on economic conditions.

* **		RoE (Return on Equity)**:
	* This measures how effectively a company's management is using shareholders' equity to generate profits. A higher RoE indicates efficient use of equity capital.
	* Imagine you gave your friend $100 to start a lemonade stand, and they made $10 profit. Your "return" on the money (equity) you gave is 10%.

* **		Debt-to-Equity Ratio**:
	* This ratio compares a company's total debt to its total equity. It gives an idea of how much leverage (debt) the company is using to finance its assets relative to the value represented by shareholders.
	* If a company has a debt-to-equity ratio of 2, it means it has twice as much debt as equity. It's like comparing how much you owe on your credit card to how much money you have in your savings account.

* **		Earnings Per Share (EPS)**:
	* This is the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. If a company earned $1 million and had 1 million shares, the EPS would be $1.
	* It's a way to see how much of the company's profit belongs to each share you own.

* **		Price to Book (P/B)**:
	* This ratio compares a company's market price per share to its book value per share. The book value is essentially what would be left if the company sold all its assets and paid off all its liabilities.
	* If a company's P/B is above 1, it means the market values it more than its book value. It's like comparing the price of a used car to its "Blue Book" value.

**Difference between Operating Margin and Profit Margin**:
* **Operating Margin**:
	* This is a measure of profitability. It shows what percentage of sales is left after subtracting the costs of goods sold and operating expenses (but before interest and taxes).
	* Think of it as how much money the company keeps from its sales after paying for the direct costs of making and selling its products or services.
* **Profit Margin**:
	* This is also a measure of profitability. It shows what percentage of sales is left after all expenses have been subtracted, including operating costs, interest, taxes, and other expenses.
	* It's like looking at how much money you have left after paying all your bills, not just the direct costs of what you're selling.

In essence, while both margins measure profitability, the operating margin focuses on operational efficiency, whereas the profit margin considers all costs and gives a more comprehensive view of the company's overall profitability.

* **		RoE (Return on Equity)**:
	* A higher RoE is generally better, indicating that the company is effectively generating profit from its equity.
	* An RoE above 15-20% is often considered good, but again, it's essential to compare with industry peers.
* **		Debt-to-Equity Ratio**:
	* A lower ratio is generally preferred as it indicates less reliance on external debt. However, some industries are more capital-intensive and may naturally have higher ratios.
	* A ratio of 1 (or 100%) means that debt equals equity, which might be considered high for many industries.
* **		Earnings Per Share (EPS)**:
	* A higher EPS indicates more earnings available to shareholders. However, it's more about the growth rate of EPS over time that investors look at rather than a specific "good" value.
* **		Price to Book (P/B)**:
	* A lower P/B ratio might indicate that the stock is undervalued. Historically, a P/B ratio under 1 is often considered good, suggesting that the stock might be undervalued relative to its book value. However, like P/E, it's essential to compare this ratio within industries.

* **		Operating Margin and Profit Margin**:
	* Higher margins are generally better, indicating more profitability. However, "good" values vary by industry. For instance, software companies might have very high margins, while grocery stores have thin margins.

It's crucial to understand that these are general guidelines, and the "good" or "recommended" values can vary based on the industry, country, and current economic conditions. Always consider the broader context and consult with financial experts or do thorough research before making investment decisions.

**Beta (5Y Monthly)** is a measure used in finance to understand the volatility or systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Here's a breakdown:
* **		Beta**:
	* Represents the sensitivity of a stock's returns to the returns of the market.
	* A beta of 1 means the stock's price will move with the market. If the market goes up by 10%, a stock with a beta of 1 will also go up by 10%.
	* A beta less than 1 means the stock is less volatile than the market. For instance, if a stock has a beta of 0.7, it's theoretically 30% less volatile than the market.
	* A beta greater than 1 indicates the stock is more volatile than the market. For example, a beta of 1.3 means the stock is 30% more volatile than the market.
* **		5Y**:
	* This indicates that the beta calculation is based on five years of historical data.
* **		Monthly**:
	* This suggests that the data points (stock returns and market returns) used in the beta calculation are taken on a monthly basis over those five years.

In essence, the "Beta (5Y Monthly)" of a company gives you an idea of how the stock's price has moved in the past five years relative to the broader market, using monthly data points. Investors use this measure to get a sense of the stock's risk profile. If you're risk-averse, you might prefer stocks with a beta less than 1, as they tend to be less volatile than the market. On the other hand, if you're looking for potentially higher returns and are willing to accept more risk, you might be interested in stocks with a beta greater than 1.
