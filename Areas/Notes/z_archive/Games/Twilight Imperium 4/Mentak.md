Green planet 

Strategies: Diplomacy/Tech/ Trade/ Leadership / Politics
When having Diplomacy try to bribe Tech owner to delay 

Research at least one more tech is crucial

Get Cruiser II in first or second turn

Techs: Neural motivator/Cruiser II, PDS II,graviton lasers, Salvage operations, Mirror computing 

Get mirror ideally in round 3 or 4. Perhaps skip PDS

If no tech or Diplomacy in first round get Politics to have Tech in 2nd round. Focus on expansion in 1st round. Sprint for mirror computing. This is basically last tech I will need

Secondary : Diplomacy, Tech, Trade?, Warfare. 

Try to collect as much trade goods as possible before mirror comp.After mirror computing start building a fleet.

Start taking Trade after Cruiser II to get money
