# Muaat 

## General:
Do one thing (tech, objective...) and then another. Don't rush

Don't overuse stall/spending strategy tokens

No supernova on home system 

`Keep Sabotage for direct hits only`

We are early game race

`Take two systems in neighborhood. Build big slice protected by war suns and PDS network.`

Negotiate, be honest and open. Keep people off my back. 

`Get what you need and hold it.`

Be solid, focus on VPs. Negotiate. Be behind the scenes. Operate inside own pie slice which should be bigger than other ones.

`Second War Sun by round 2 should be first target`

Ideal first round - take warfare and tech as secondary. Move into 2 systems. Maybe use Forge to stall

Low fleet to 2

Try to negotiate to get more pie slice 
I can give my promissory note. They don't have enough money to get it early.give this PN only for a victory point

Let's have 2x2 techs colors especially if they are amongst the objectives.

Don't use Star Forge in mid game.

Don't be a Mecatol race. Gain trade goods for wiping them out for other players 

Go after Arborec from the start if in neighborhood 

## Dreadnought II path:
More secure 
If mighty fleet secret objective
If bad map and worse chance to get big pie slice 
1. Do you desperately need flexible movement options by round two?
2. Do you foresee a need for Fleet Logistics and/or Light/Wave Deflector?
3. Do you have the Gather a Mighty Fleet Secret Objective?
4. Do you need more than two strong fleets with movement >1 to manage conflict on your perimeter? 

Gravity drive in 1st round  if possible.if not than 2 blues and 2 yellows

Upgrades - PDS II, Dreadnought/carrier
`
`
Tech: sarween, antimass deflectors, gravity drive, dread 2, pds 2, graviton
Units: (fleet pool of 5) 2 prototype warsun 1, 5 dread 2, 3 destroyers, 20 fighters, 5 infantry, 2 spacedocks, 4 pds. Cost: around 42 resources and several counters for stalling and secondary construction. In a regular game I would play construction, tech and leadership once. You will be well protected, and should be able to attack and threaten neighbours from round 2

## War Sun II path:
More risky
If red tech planet
Red techs. Duranium, Sarveen

Upgrades - WS II, PDS II, Destroyer II 
`
`

## Strategy Cards:
Warfare to take planets. Better than Tech
Warfare secondary in 1st round. Stall and get two system or units

Tech secondary has higher priority than warfare secondary 

Donâ€™t do tech if somebody is breathing on my neck and produce ground units instead

Take Trade as 3rd option and stall for fighters

Construction 

Diplomacy: Hopefully you picked up two fantastic planets with your War Sun and can flip them for more than four resources. If not, your home planet will be sufficient.

## Enemies:
Targets - ground round races. Sol. Arborec. Sardak - they must be knocked down very early. Winnu - wipe them out from MR or let them pay.

Threats - Yssaril, Xxcha, Yin Brotherhood, L1Z1, Ghosts (conditional, in late game). Mentak cruisers and PDSs
