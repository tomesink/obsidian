Arborec 

Don't forget place infantry 

Focus on getting Second carrier 

No need to build anything I 1st round. Focus on army.

Build flagship early

I'll need lots of command counters 

Focus on having lots of money 

First  Set up good pie slice and than build fleets an gain VPs (II tier of VPS)

And Eat one of your neighbors 

Strategy: Diplomacy but I need to have 4 resources on planets. Then build 1 carrier a spend 4 resources for secondary tech sarwen tools

Trade, Tech, Leadership in mid game 

Tech: Sarween, than go green path to get hypermetabolism but it depends. Focus on objectives. Perhaps PDS, infantry (maybe not necessary because I'll have lots of infantry)

Counters: Lizax, Sardak, Barony, war sun
