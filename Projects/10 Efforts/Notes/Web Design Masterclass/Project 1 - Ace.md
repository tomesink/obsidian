# Project 1 - Ace

## Wireframes

Matt starts with Hi-Fi wireframes, with auto layout to use it as a foundation to build on top of and iterate into visual design phase. He do not want to have a lo-fi wireframe just as a reference and throw away. He wants to start with proper auto layouts, sizing, font and make the font good looking.

### Navbar
Set navbar text items to vertical trim.

### Spacing

Spacing between sections: small (88), medium (128) and large (200) defaults for 8px grid system. Divide the number by 2 to get the half padding: We are going with 128 -> 64px up and bottom paddings. Do not forget to set the section to hug height (and fill container width).

Matt likes the social proof being in the hero section.


### Alignment

Want to align odd number (5 in this case) of columns with your 12 column grid?

Just add an empty rectangle where it is best suited (after the logo or at the end):

After the logo is better in this case:

Matt do not enjoy illustrations on web site unless a client demands it.

The figma logo on white background means we need to build fake UI, not use a photo nor icon

### Carousel wireframe

Something like this:

## Inspiration

Look for keywords in the project brief.

### Moodboard

Use Pinterest.

Matt uses Figma as a moodboard.

In this moodboarding/visual/color finding phase Matt is not looking for web site inspirations.  He looks at visual purely. There is already lots of visual inspirations. 

Matt do not want to overwhelm himself by going into the web because there is a chance to find a website I like and a danger to fall into a trap of copying too much from it.

It is better to have a moodboard providing us some visual direction 

![[Pasted image 20241002111840.png|350]]

and figure out the web by ourselves.

Look for patterns in the moodboard, similar pictures, color palettes and sort/group them:

### Web pages

Now it's the time to look at some web inspirations.

Matt uses [Godly — Astronomically good web design inspiration](https://godly.website/)

Take screenshots, search based on the keyword.

### Fonts

Matt searches for big bold unique fonts (could be serifs) for headlines.

He chooses sans-serif for body.

Do not spend too much time on font. Do not let choosing fonts block your progress.

Matt uses WhatFont extension [WhatFont - Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm)

Matt uses [Pangram Pangram Foundry — Free to Try Quality Fonts and Typefaces](https://pangrampangram.com/) to get Fonts.


Adobe fonts for serifs. [Search fonts | Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts) 

Serif fonts not suited for buttons.

Try to find 2-4 fonts for Headings and 2-4 fonts for body and try to combine them to see if they fit

![[Pasted image 20241002130915.png|350]]

To find a similar (but free) typeface as Matt uses you can use Typewolf to find suggestions. Because Typewolf doesn't have a search function on their website, just type "Rauschen B Typewolf" in Google and you'll find the page if they have a page for this typeface. [https://www.typewolf.com/](https://www.typewolf.com/)


### Colors

From the moodboard, use the eyedrop tool and create several palettes of 2 colors:

![[Pasted image 20241002131409.png|250]]

Feel free to customize (eg. saturate,, de-saturate) the colors. You do not have to use the exact same HEX values. Try to customize them a little bit.

## Images

You need to have consistent images. Stack photos are kind of limited in that sense.

Matt advice is to refer to the Wireframe.

Write down what kind of imagery you need for each section/feature:

![[Pasted image 20241002164614.png|350]]

Matt uses [DEATH TO STOCK](https://www.deathtothestockphoto.com/), alternatively also [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)

## Exploration

Matt identified 3 fonts combinations a 3 styles from moodboard and have 2 versions of wireframe. He duplicated a wireframe so that he can match a font combo and style to each wireframe and also assign the simple colors:

![[Pasted image 20241003094137.png]]

Now we have 3 directions to work with. This is done in a separate Figma page. He copy pasted the wireframes from Wireframe page into Exploration page and he will start colorizing them.

Use a font replacer in figma to replace fonts in batch: [figma.com/community/plugin/1100808562040625391/font-replacer-ultimate-swap-change-and-replace-fonts](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1100808562040625391/font-replacer-ultimate-swap-change-and-replace-fonts)

In this step Matt does the font "audit" and fixes and customizes all fonts for a concept (eg. Home A), the font sizes, line height, letter spacing.
