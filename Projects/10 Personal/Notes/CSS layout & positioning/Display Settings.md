Display:**none** is completly hidden from the page (but still inside the code). It is not rendered

vs

opacity 0% the element is on the page and takes up space even if not visible

**Inline**: width and height can not be changed manually (only with the amount of content). Default view for spans. You can use align Y property.

For resizing inline displays manually use **inline-block**.
