# Episode 6 - Layout

The hardest possibly skill to master.

#### What makes a good layout?
- clear, not confusing (hierarchy)
- interesting, not boring
- easy to consume the content


#### Basic principles of successful design

##### 1. Big, medium, small rule

In every design there must be a thing which is really big, something which is medium and something that's small. It creates contrast

Example:

From this:

Into this:

![[Pasted image 20240913174446.png]]

it is interesting that the small thing works almowst everywhere. It does not matter where you put it:

![[Pasted image 20240913174552.png]]

Here the title is the biggest, and white (good contrast).
The red rectangle is the medium.
The top text is the small thing.

The big photo is just a background. Not part of hierachy?

Similarly here, the backgroud picture probably not part of the hierarchy.
