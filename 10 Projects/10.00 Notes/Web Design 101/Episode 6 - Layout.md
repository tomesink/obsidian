# Episode 6 - Layout

The hardest possibly skill to master.

#### What makes a good layout?
- clear, not confusing (hierarchy)
- interesting, not boring
- easy to consume the content


#### Basic principles of successful design

##### 1. Big, medium, small rule

In every design there must be a thing which is really big, something which is medium and something that's small. It creates contrast

Example:

From this:

Into this:

![[Pasted image 20240913174446.png]]

it is interesting that the small thing works almowst everywhere. It does not matter where you put it:

![[Pasted image 20240913174552.png]]

Here the title is the biggest, and white (good contrast).
The red rectangle is the medium.
The top text is the small thing.

The big photo is just a background. Not part of hierachy?

1. A digital agency...
2. In Ran's opinion the medium could be the text in background. It is bigger but less readable, gray. Or it could be the text "We are creative ...."
3. Button, logo, we are Baunfire
