# Episode 11 - Website Content Structure

What pages we want have on our website? What kind of conent we want to have there?
These questions need to be answered *before* wireframing (notice *relume* - they do exactly this).

How to find out:

## 1. Find out the goals of the web pages

By interviewing/brainstorming the client. Why they want a website. Why they want to update their web. What are they business needs (hire new people?, sell something?).

Brainstorm and identify primary and secondary goals.

## 2.  Brainstorm and list all types of content supporting the goals

Eg. if they want to sell a new product, they need: explanation (what the product  is), why and how it is better than competition...

Maybe they want to share the company's history, the team members etc...

We need to brainstorm together with the client. We need to have some (initial) idea about the structure by ourselves as designers and discuss it with the client.

We can use bullet points to capture all thetype of content.

## 3. Start organizing the content where it makes sense

 We can take all the bullet points from the point 2. and organise it
 into sections.

Example (of site map):

U can use card sorting method (write the bullet points on cards and sort it together).
Could this be done in FigJam or other remote method (Trello maybe?).

## 4. Decide the r

Decide between one-pager architecture or multiple pages.
