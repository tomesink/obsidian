# Episode 11 - Website Content Structure

What pages we want have on our website? What kind of conent we want to have there?
These questions need to be answered *before* wireframing (notice *relume* - they do exactly this).

How to find out:

## 1. Find out the goals of the web pages

By interviewing/brainstorming the client. Why they want a website. Why they want to update their web. What are they business needs (hire new people?, sell something?).

Brainstorm and identify primary and secondary goals.

## 2.  Brainstorm and list all types of content supporting the goals

Eg. if they want to sell a new product, they need: explanation (what the product  is), why and how it is better than competition...

Maybe they want to shasre
