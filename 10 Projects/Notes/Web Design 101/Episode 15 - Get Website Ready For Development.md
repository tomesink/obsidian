# Episode 15 - Get Website Ready For Development

## 1.  Finish the design!

Think about different states of buttons etc. Prototype hover states, menu navigations etc. These states must be designed.

Even if I will be the one who is implementing the design.

## 2. Have all styles ready

Styles, colors, (variables), typography... everything must be ready and consistent and documented.

## 3. Exporting assets

We will be exporting the following types of assets:

#### SVG 

Vector files. Very small, can be scaled and put as code in webflow.

#### JPEG

For big pictures, hero sections etc. Smaller than PNG files. Set the export size to 2x. 

#### Layers

Animations, PNGs...

## 4. Compress files

Because 2x JPEG or PNGs are big, we need to compress them to optimise web performance. We can use [tinipng](TinyPNG â€“ Compress WebP, PNG and JPEG images intelligently](https://tinypng.com/) for this.
