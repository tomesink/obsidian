# Episode 14 Homepage in Adobe XD

Just see the source video if needed.

Adobe XD is discontinued. Also, I am using Figma anyways so this video is not relevant.

Just some minor hints:

Use grids for layout and content padding.

Final design. For real project the girl's head would be "brought back" in Photoshop (the whole image is overlayed with black opacity because of readability. In real Project the head would be masked and not so dark).
