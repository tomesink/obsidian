# Episode 17 - # How To Find Web Design Inspiration To Stand Out

## 1. Competitors

Look up websites of your client's competitors. Wee what's working and what's not.
Use google. Take screenshots of their webs. This will help to communicate with a client why I do what I do, why I design how I design.

## 2. Design Inspiration Websites

The websites bellow are good place to look for an inspiration. They are collecting designs, web pages, designers and their works.

Make sure you take screenshots of the design you like.
