# Episode 7 - colors

Check out the link bellow about meanings of color and try to understand it.

Use some color picker/palette tool to find suitable fits for your colors. 

Choose a color based on the psychology and than choose other colors to fit the main color to create harmony palette.

## 60-30-10 rule:

60% - main color
30% - secondary color
10% - accent color

not fixed. It does not haveto be really 60, realy exact 30, really 10.

The purpose is to create contrast (similar to Big, smaller, small in [[Episode 6 - Layout]]).

##### Example1:

60 - purple
30 - red (picture)
10 - white

10 - black

This is the same page scrolled down. The section is using different color but still keeps the 60-30-10 rule:
