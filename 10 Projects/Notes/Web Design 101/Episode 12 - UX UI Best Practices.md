# Episode 12 - UX UI Best Practices

## Navigations

Making sure the people know where they are on the website.

#### Good example 1:

Mac navbar menu is greyed out when we are in mac section. We can also see the corresponding sub menu for macs.

After clicking on macbook pro I can see it on sub menu and this menu stays with me all the time. I know where I am.

If i want to go from home page to funding options:

I can see the "Fungind options" are not highlighted or marked. I do not know where I am:
