# Episode 9 - Wireframes

Focusing only on content (copy) and structure, not design, colors etc.

ALWAYS start with pen and paper!

After that  put it in Figma. 
This is the stage in which you will align on web structure, content and copy.
Once approved you can move into visual design.

If it's an internal/personal project (or client is ok with it) you can do the visual design from the paper and skip Figma phase. (but as other youtuber does: it is good to have copy ready and finished during wireframing phase).
