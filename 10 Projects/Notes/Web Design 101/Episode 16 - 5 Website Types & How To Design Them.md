# Episode 16 - 5 Website Types & How To Design Them

## E-Commerce

Goal is to sell the product.

The main things are:
### 1. Product Showcase

How you showcase the product? Photo? Is it on white or black background? Is it seen from all angles? Designer has to art directing this. Show different variations (colors, sizes) of the product.


### 2. Checkout Process

This is where the money comes from. Use the best practices. 

##### Example 1

Direct focus on shoes.

Shoes, shoes, shoes... all different variations and scenarios.

They split the checkout process into three steps (instead of one). In the first step users put their e-mail address. Lots of them do not finish the checkout process and they can target them again later because they have their address and can make sure they come back.

## Marketing / Business (Company) Website

Most popular kind of website because millions of businesses need a website. Even an offline business needs a presentation, need share its contact.

Design challenges:

### 1. Clear description, value proposition, benefits

Who they are? What they do? How they differ from competition? This has to be very clear.

Copywriting is crucial here.

### 2. Storytelling

You need to tell a story (this is not as important as for e-commerce).

Who they are. Create emotion/connection with customer. Create trust.

### 3. Social Proof

Testimonials etc. Make people trust you more.

### 4. Call To Action

Tell people what to do (contact, subscribe for newsletter...). Take the relationship to the next level.

##### Example

Very clear message this is Pilates studio.
