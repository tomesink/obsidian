# Episode 16 - 5 Website Types & How To Design Them

## E-Commerce

Goal is to sell the product.

The main things are:
### 1. Product Showcase

How you showcase the product? Photo? Is it on white or black background? Is it seen from all angles? Designer has to art directing this. Show different variations (colors, sizes) of the product.


### 2. Checkout Process

This is where the money comes from. Use the best practices. 

##### Example 1

Direct focus on shoes.

Shoes, shoes, shoes... all different variations and scenarios.

They split the checkout process into three steps (instead of one). In the first step users put their e-mail address. Lots of them do not finish the checkout process and they can target them again later because they have their address and can make sure they come back.

## Marketing / Business (Company) Website

Most popular kind of website because millions of businesses need a website. Even an offline business needs a presentation, need share its contact.

Design challenges:

### 1. Clear description, value proposition, benefits

Who they are? What they do? How they differ from competition? This has to be very clear.

Copywriting is crucial here.

### 2. Storytelling

You need to tell a story (this is not as important as for e-commerce).

Who they are. Create emotion/connection with customer. Create trust.

### 3. Social Proof

Testimonials etc. Make people trust you more.

### 4. Call To Action

Tell people what to do (contact, subscribe for newsletter...). Take the relationship to the next level.

##### Example

Very clear message this is Pilates studio. Optimised to create trust, not to sell anything.

Social proof does not have to be just testimonials...

Build credibility by showing their teachers, clients, methods...

## Blog / Media Outlet

For content creating websites you need to focus on common basic things:

### 1. Content

Purpose of these websites is to make people read. Design an article will be the main challenge. 

### 2. Imagery 

Because just reading text is boring. Image cane be inside the post or kind of a hero/banner to trigger people to click on it. 

### 3. Categorisation

Using tags or categories to organise items/articles/topics.

##### Example

Notice categories are exposed on the top (Environment, Poverty ....)

![[Pasted image 20240925201920.png]]

We have big hero sections here with main/latest posts.

![[Pasted image 20240925202138.png]]

Inside the article. Also nice hero-like design after clicking on the link.

And than, when you scroll, strong focus on the text

Simetimes broken down with decent imagery

![[Pasted image 20240925202410.png]]

Sometimes with bigger imagery

![[Pasted image 20240925202510.png]]

But main focus is on text. The type is big, no too long lines, very readable. Sometimes broken with quotes.

All articles have social sharing buttons to get more traffic.


## Educational

These websites have very different design challenges as those above:

### 1. Engagement

It is very hard to keep people in the course. At the beginning they are excited but after a while they loose focus and motivation.

So it is very difficult to keep people engaged, excited.
### 2. Orientation

People need to know where are they in the learning process. How long this chapter takes, can I jump into next lesson etc.

##### Example

Its kind of "course" about the internet, history and its future. Lots of interaction, not just reading.

They break text with interactions, small games, etc. Very good navigation.
