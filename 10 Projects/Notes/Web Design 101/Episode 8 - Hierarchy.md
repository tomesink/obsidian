# Episode 8 - Hierarchy

We as designers need to navigate the eyes from the most important thing hierarchically. What to look at first, than look at this secondary thing and than look here on the least important thing.

It relates to [[Episode 6 - Layout]]

## Examples
##### Bad example 1:

Everything is green and black. everything is trying to "scream" at me. Not sure where to look at first. I am overhelmed.

##### Bad example 2:

Logo is the biggest thing here. Everything is blue, the buttons including the CTA. Not sure where to look at first, what is the important button.

#### Bad example 3:

No hierarchy at all.

#### Good example 1

Good size and contrast of the text.

#### Good example 2

Biggest is the picture, but the eyes moves to the text immediately.

#### Good example 3

From visuals/pictures -> text.

The good examples guide your eyes.


## How to create hierarchies?

### Size difference

We can follow the usual Big - medium - small pattern.

or

1 primary, 1 secondary the rest tertiary

Color difference is used on button/CTA:

We do not know where to click first:

vs

pimary (buy now) and secondary (learn)

### Position difference


The leftmost element immediately grabs our attention:

The typical price plan:

or combination of position and/or size and/or color:
