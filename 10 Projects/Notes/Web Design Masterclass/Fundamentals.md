# Fundamentals

## 8px grid system

Helps us with consistency.

Is further divisible by 4 or 2 in comparison eg 5px so we can get more values (2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20 vs.  5,10,15,20,25,30). Its much more granular.

Works well with % based font-sizes (rem).

If we'd like to achieve the same with say 10px it would be horrible.
This does not help anybody:

## Responsivnes

### Breakpoints
In Figma these breakpoints are enough:

- Desktop *1440px*
- Tablet *810px*
-  Phone *390px*

### Guides
For Figma guides (columns)

#### Desktop 

Use 12 *columns* with 23-40px gaps.

You can easily divide them:

You can use any combination

Use 24-64px *margins*

Do not forget to set max-width! It is a good practice.

Unless you want intentionally some element (eg. picture) to go edge to edge on big size screens). 

If an element do not have max width, you should document it.
### Tablet

6 columns, 32 gaps and margins

### Phone

2-4 columns, 24px
