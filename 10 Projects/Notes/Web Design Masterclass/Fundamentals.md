# Fundamentals

## 8px grid system

Helps us with consistency.

Is further divisible by 4 or 2 in comparison eg 5px so we can get more values (2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20 vs.  5,10,15,20,25,30). Its much more granular.

Works well with % based font-sizes (rem).

If we'd like to achieve the same with say 10px it would be horrible.
This does not help anybody:

## Responsivnes

### Breakpoints
In Figma these breakpoints are enough:

- Desktop *1440px*
- Tablet *810px*
-  Phone *390px*

### Guides
For Figma guides (columns)

#### Desktop 

Use *12 columns*

You can easily divide them:

You can use any combination
