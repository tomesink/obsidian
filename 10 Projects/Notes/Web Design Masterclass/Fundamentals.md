# Fundamentals

## 8px grid system

Helps us with consistency.

Is further divisible by 4 or 2 in comparison eg 5px so we can get more values (2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20 vs.  5,10,15,20,25,30). Its much more granular.

Works well with % based font-sizes (rem).

If we'd like to achieve the same with say 10px it would be horrible.
This does not help anybody:

## Responsivnes

### Breakpoints
In Figma these breakpoints are enough:

- Desktop *1440px*
- Tablet *810px*
-  Phone *390px*

### Guides
For Figma guides (columns).

#### Desktop 

Use 12 *columns* with 23-40px gaps.

You can easily divide them:

You can use any combination

Use 24-64px *margins*

Do not forget to set max-width! It is a good practice.

Unless you want intentionally some element (eg. picture) to go edge to edge on big size screens). 

If an element do not have max width, you should document it.
### Tablet

6 columns, 32 gaps and margins

### Phone

2-4 columns, 24px

## Spacing

There are no actual rules to follow. Should this card have 24px margin or 32? Should the icon after text has gap 4px or 8 px? It depends... there is no rulebook.

We can ask these questions to help decide:

- Is the spacing helping group the right content together to help the user understand what UI elements are related to each other?
- Is there enough space between the elements to actually feel comfortable?
- Does anything feel visually unbalanced?
- Does the spacing feel cohesive? Whether it is a single UI element, section or the whole site. (Its always good to take step back and just see how cohesive your spacing and layouts are feeling. This is an ongoing thing, always check this.). 

## Colors

Again, no rules to follow on how many colors should I use or how do I pick my color palette.

The easiest way is to follow 60/30/10 rule.

60% dominant color (background color)
