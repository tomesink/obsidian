# Project 1 - Ace

## Wireframes

Matt starts with Hi-Fi wireframes, with auto layout to use it as a foundation to build on top of and iterate into visual design phase. He do not want to have a lo-fi wireframe just as a reference and throw away. He wants to start with proper auto layouts, sizing, font and make the font good looking.

### Navbar
Set navbar text items to vertical trim.

### Spacing

Spacing between sections: small (88), medium (128) and large (200) defaults for 8px grid system. Divide the number by 2 to get the half padding: We are going with 128 -> 64px up and bottom paddings. Do not forget to set the section to hug height (and fill container width).

Matt likes the social proof being in the hero section.


### Alignment

Want to align odd number of columns with your 12 column grid?
