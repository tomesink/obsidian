# Project 1 - Ace

## Wireframes

Matt starts with Hi-Fi wireframes, with auto layout to use it as a foundation to build on top of and iterate into visual design phase. He do not want to have a lo-fi wireframe just as a reference and throw away. He wants to start with proper auto layouts, sizing, font and make the font good looking.

### Navbar
Set navbar text items to vertical trim.

### Spacing

Spacing between sections: small (88), medium (128) and large (200) defaults for 8px grid system. Divide the number by 2 to get the half padding: We are going with 128 -> 64px up and bottom paddings. Do not forget to set the section to hug height (and fill container width).

Matt likes the social proof being in the hero section.


### Alignment

Want to align odd number (5 in this case) of columns with your 12 column grid?

Just add an empty rectangle where it is best suited (after the logo or at the end):

After the logo is better in this case:

Matt do not enjoy illustrations on web site unless a client demands it.

The figma logo on white background means we need to build fake UI, not use a photo nor icon
