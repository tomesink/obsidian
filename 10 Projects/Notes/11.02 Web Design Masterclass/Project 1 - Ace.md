## Wireframes

Matt starts with Hi-Fi wireframes, with auto layout to use it as a foundation to build on top of and iterate into visual design phase. He do not want to have a lo-fi wireframe just as a reference and throw away. He wants to start with proper auto layouts, sizing, font and make the font good looking.

### Navbar
