# Project 1 - Ace

## Wireframes

Matt starts with Hi-Fi wireframes, with auto layout to use it as a foundation to build on top of and iterate into visual design phase. He do not want to have a lo-fi wireframe just as a reference and throw away. He wants to start with proper auto layouts, sizing, font and make the font good looking.

### Navbar
Set navbar text items to vertical trim.

### Spacing

Spacing between sections: small (88), medium (128) and large (200) defaults for 8px grid system. Divide the number by 2 to get the half padding: We are going with 128 -> 64px up and bottom paddings. Do not forget to set the section to hug height (and fill container width).

Matt likes the social proof being in the hero section.


### Alignment

Want to align odd number (5 in this case) of columns with your 12 column grid?

Just add an empty rectangle where it is best suited (after the logo or at the end):

After the logo is better in this case:

Matt do not enjoy illustrations on web site unless a client demands it.

The figma logo on white background means we need to build fake UI, not use a photo nor icon

### Carousel wireframe

Something like this:

### Moodboard

Use Pinterest.

Matt uses Figma as a moodboard.

In this moodboarding/visual/color finding phase Matt is not looking for web site inspirations.  He looks at visual purely. There is already lots of visual inspirations. 

Matt do not want to overwhelm himself by going into the web because there is a chance to find a website I like and a danger to fall into a trap of copying too much from it.

It is better to have a moodboard providing us some visual direction

and figure out the web by ourselves.

Look for patterns in the moodboard, similar pictures, color palettes and sort/group them:

### Web pages

Now it's the time to look at some web inspirations.

Matt uses [Godly — Astronomically good web design inspiration](https://godly.website/)

Take screenshots, search based on the keyword.

## Fonts

Matt searches for big bold unique fonts (could be serifs) for headlines.

He chooses sans-serif for body.

Do not spend too much time on font. Do not let choosing fonts block your progress.

Matt uses WhatFont extension [WhatFont - Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm)

Matt uses [Pangram Pangram Foundry — Free to Try Quality Fonts and Typefaces](https://pangrampangram.com/) to get Fonts.


Adobe fonts for serifs. [Search fonts | Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts) 

Serif fonts not suited for buttons.

Try to find 2-4 fonts for Headings and 2-4 fonts for body and try to combine them to see if they fit

## Colors

From the moodboard, use the eyedrop tool and create several palettes of 2 colors:

![[Pasted image 20241002131409.png|250]]

Feel free to customize (eg. saturate,, de-saturate) the colors. You do not have to use the exact same HEX values. Try to customize them a little bit.
