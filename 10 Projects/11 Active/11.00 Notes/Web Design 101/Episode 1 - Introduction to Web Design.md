The purpose of this course is to provide free starting point so that people can buy advanced courses from Flux Academy later on.

### What is Web Design

Graphic desing + web

### Why I Should Care?

- Websites are not going anywhere. They will be always here (no matter in which form or technology build with - coded, no code, AI build someone always must create them professionally).

- I can work remotely.

- I can express my own ideas and creativity

### AI Threat (Not from the course but from Flux Academy newsletter)

Last week, Figma announced a bunch of new features, among them the ability to create a full design based on a prompt using AI.  
  
Designers all over the internet raged in fear, as they saw what used to take them hours done in seconds and imagined their jobs evaporating.

I think some of them are right.  
  
There are lots of highly paid product designers ("UX/UI designers") in tech whose job is to create new screens based onÂ existing design systems. A technical job that will soon be VERY easy (and cheap) to replace.  
  
Will some lose their jobs? Probably. So why am I not concerned? Two main reasons:  
  
**1. Web design is very different from UX/UI design**  
  
While the focus of UX/UI design is on usability and logic, within a design system, web design is a marketing tool where creativity, storytelling, image-making, and "look & feel" play a larger role.  
  
Yes, you can use AI tools like Relume to speed up your wireframing process, but you still have to come up with creative ideas on how to make the website stand out from competitors.  
  
Right now, AI is still very far from being able to do that well.  
  
**2. Freelancing is a service business**  
  
Unlike companies that can fire 95% of their design team and have a single designer using Figma create the work of 100 designers, freelance clients still need someone to do the job.  
  
People tend to forget that clients hire you because they want YOU to do the job. They don't want to sit around and play with Figma AI or any other AI tool. If they had patience for this, they could have used Wix or any other DIY builder, but they hire a professional because they want someone else to do the job.  
  
Additionally, a single freelancer cannot service 100 clients at a time, no matter how good AI is. People want good, personal service from the professional they work with.  
  
Will our tools change? For sure.  
  
Do we have to keep adjusting our processes to be competitive? Yep.  
  
But freelancing as a web designer is here to stay.
