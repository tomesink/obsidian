Design system communicates the "what", "how" and "why".

Key parts of a successful design system:

1. Principles
2. Foundations
3. Documentation
4. Process

## Why (Principles)

This is the principles. eg. "Be accessible and inclusive". 
The message the company communicates.

## What (Foundations)

Visual styles, colors, typography, components.
Patterns: Behaviors, Strucutres, Conventions

#### Accessibility

Always have accessibility (A11y) in mind. This could mean also dark mode, large enough buttons, missing alts on images.

- [Library: Accessibility resources, guides, communities, and more](https://www.getstark.co/library/)

#### Colors

Colors can have different meaning in different cultures. Eg. Red is danger in West, but prosperity in the East.

Can create hierarchy.

Have your color palette as simplified as possible (you can grow it later as the project evolves). It is advised to simplify similar colors into one. Avoid having multiple colors for primary buttons (eg. 5 colours).

Use 60-30-10 rule to create balance: 60% should be neutral color, 30% primary color, 10% should be secondary color or call to action color if we have one. You can add more colors/shades as the system evolves.

Base/body text size often 16px. Use scale 1.24 for scaling the base font:

`16 * 1.25 = 20 * 1.25 = 24 *
