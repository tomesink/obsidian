Design system communicates the "what", "how" and "why".

Key parts of a successful design system:

1. Principles
2. Foundations
3. Documentation
4. Process

## Why (Principles)

This is the principles. eg. "Be accessible and inclusive". 
The message the company communicates.

## What (Foundations)

Visual styles, colors, typography, components.
Patterns: Behaviors, Strucutres, Conventions

#### Accessibility

Always have accessibility (A11y) in mind. This could mean also dark mode, large enough buttons, missing alts on images.

- [Colorblind Accessibility Manifesto](https://colorblindaccessibilitymanifesto.com/)
- [Library: Accessibility resources, guides, communities, and more](https://www.getstark.co/library/)

#### Colors

Colors can have different meaning in different cultures. Eg. Red is danger in West, but prosperity in the East.

Can create hierarchy.

Have your color palette as simplified as possible (you can grow it later as the project evolves). It is advised to simplify similar colors into one. Avoid having multiple colors for primary buttons (eg. 5 colours).

Use 60-30-10 rule to create balance: 60% should be neutral color, 30% primary color, 10% should be secondary color or call to action color if we have one. You can add more colors/shades as the system evolves.

#### Typography

Base/body text size often 16px. Use scales for scaling the base font consistently:

You can use the **major third (1.25)**:
`16 * 1.25 = 20 * 1.25 = 25 * 1.25 = 31.25`
`16 / 1.25 = 12.80 / 1.25 = 10.24`

Or **perfect forth (1.333)**.

In Figma we can use several plugins for scaling (see links bellow).

If we use 8pt grid system, we should round the type size to the nearest number which is multiple of 8. Do the same for the line height.

Example of web type hierarchy:

Mobile apps usually have different classification hierarchy:

You can have different fonts for headings and for text (eg. for blogs).

Prevent having too many type sizes. You will usually use them in a wrong way.

#### Elevation

Shadows on button hover, overlays, etc...
Do not use them on mobiles. 

Do not use true black as a shadow color. Use a socolr from your color palette instead. Use blur.

#### Iconography

Good icons can enhance company's visual identity. Provides consistent user experience.

Icons should be functional and recognizable.

#### Spacing, grids & layouts

We need to have a consistent spatial system. 

Use different layouts for different screen sizes (responsive).

Example of grid usage:

![[Screenshot 2024-09-16 at 18.03.27.png]]

On desktop 8-12 grids is a standard.
The space around the edge of the grid is called *margin* and the gaps amongst comluns are called *gutter*.
