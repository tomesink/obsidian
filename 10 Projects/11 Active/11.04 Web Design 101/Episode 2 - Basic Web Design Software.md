### Image

Always pixelated bitmap. Computer must remember position and color of each pixel. We are limited with size. Image is a bitmap and when zooming it gets pixelated.

Use Photoshop or Affinity Photo 2 eg. for color editing, adding color layers, fonts, overlays, opacities. Use this for color effects.

Image editors use concepts of layers and masks, blend modes.

 Always name your layers.

### Vector

Not pixelized. Vector (shape) is (trajectory) calculation between two points (or points). Computer just remember the points and (re)calculates them. We are not limited with size. We can zoom to infinity.

Use Illustrator or Affinity Designer 2 for vectors, typically for icons, fonts, logos etc. We can scale them and the image (svg) size will be smaller than for bitmaps.

Also uses layers. Always name your layers.

### Screen Design Software

Put images and shapes  and assets together.

Use Figma to create web components. Use for layouts, grids, animations, prototypes.
