# 711.1.1 Typography creates feeling

Words are powerful that's why text is important.

Type of font can create a feel about what we want to communicate through our design.

Typeface = font.

Typography is a crafty skill. I need to practice a lot with manipulating fonts. It takes time to learn to see what is good and what is not.

**The purpose of the font**:
1. Deliver information (legibility). It needs to be easy to read (bad font, too small/big, not readable color).
2. Communicate values (aesthetics). Is this a friendly brand? Serious brand?
