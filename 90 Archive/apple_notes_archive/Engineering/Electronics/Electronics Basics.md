**Electricity** Is a the sum of electrical phenomena

**Voltage** [`U`] is a difference in electric potencial betwen positive
(anod) and negative (catod). It is measured in Volts [`V`].

In another words the voltage is a difference in the number of electric
charge carriers.

The unconnected battery does not do any work yet. Voltage itself does 
nothing no work no power.

**Current** [`I`] (from french intensite of courrant). It is measured in
ampers [`A`]. It is an orderly movement of the electric charge carriers
through a conductor (usually wire). The carriers are usually electrons
but in water it could be ions (particles[atoms,moleculs] with electric
charge).

It is also a number of carriers went through a conductor.

The agreed direction of the electric current is from negative to positive.
But the real movement of the carriers is just opposite: from negative to
positive.
