Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) is a feature that
automatically adjusts the number of pod replicas based on real-time
performance metrics, such as CPU utilization or custom metrics. HPA
helps to ensure that an application can scale out to handle increased
load and scale in when the load decreases.
