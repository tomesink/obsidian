The main principle is that a program should do one thing, do it only and do it well.

It's basically a LEGO principle. Create small building blocks which do one
thing only but do it well. And than connect these small building blocks.

That's why I do not want to use Vim with many plugins but want to use
as much cmd commands from inside Vim as possible.

Unix is minimalistic a connect things.
