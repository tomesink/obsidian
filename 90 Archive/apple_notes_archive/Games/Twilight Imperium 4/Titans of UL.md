**The Titans of UL**

  

objective focussed!

  

place sleeper tokens on every planet you explore right from the start. They can always be moved during later exploration.

  

Prioritize plastic (Cruisers) over Tech. 

  

Alliance Cabal

  

Do not rush Mecatol first. You can take it later

  

We are Light Wave Deflector faction

  

Maybe try to sell Promisory note for 2 trade goods, refresh commodity, or faction promisory

  

We can leave system to capture more planets and reactivate the left system later to get PDS there with sleeper tokens.

  

No need to rush for Cruiser II in round 1

  

By round 3 have all Cruisers on the board

  

Maybe War Sun ?

  

Place forward dock

  

Sleeper tokens stay on a planet someone captured from me = I can activate it and place a Mech + 1 infantry

  

Flagship is quite week. Two Saturn Engine II cruisers are objectively better in every way (other than requiring two fleet tokens instead of one)

  

With Scanlink Drone network tech I can explore already explored planet????

Activate a system with a PDS, possibly awaken a sleeper, explore, place a sleeper token, build a free unit or two, collect a trade good. 

  

  

  

  

**Strategy cards round 1**

  

In 4 players Diplo + Warfare (better secondary) would be a good combo

  

1. Trade (and find trade partner) and get plastic on the board (build ALL cruisers ASAP)
2. Construction (get Commander early)
3. Leadership (it is not critical to have tokens for sleeper tokens, unless structure objective is in play)
4. Tech
5. Warfare - use just for build at home and move. Better than diplo
6. Diplo (if someone took Tech I can do Tech first than build at home unless not stalled)
7. Politics
8. Imperial

  

  

  

Warfare - build at home and move to other planets. Probably better than diplo

Tech - no need to take tech run 1.

Politics - not necessary round 1, I dont have enough influence for Mecatol

  

  

**Technologies**

  

1. AI Development Algorithm (to skip to Cruisers II) 
2. Cruisers II
3. PDS2 
4. Sarveene (with Commander only) maybe go Blue now
5. PLASMA Scoring and and than go BLUE (???)
6. Gravity drive
7. Light Wave Deflector
8. Whatever goals say. Magen Defense grid and Maybe War Sun, maybe Transit diodes (useful for Home system defence or Mecatol Defence). Maybe sling relay?

  

  

  

**Production**

  

4 (home planet) Cruiser + 2 infantry + 2 Fighters

  

If diplo, I can build twice in my home system (with warfare secondary) unless someone plays Warfare right after my first build (before my diplo). But I will lock built plastics in round 1 but be prepared for round 2 (get all Cruisers priority). I can build 2 cruisers with Home planet than another cruiser + infantry with diplo + warfare secondary
